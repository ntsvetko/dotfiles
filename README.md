# My Setup ðŸŒŸ

I'm including some config files as well as general lists of things that I use here. They aren't really great for copying, as there's some things that change from computer to computer, but they work for reference! 

## Included in Repo
* `.vimrc`
* `.zshrc`
* `.tmux.conf`
* `.theme.conf` -- tmux theme file

## Things To Download
### Mac OS X:
* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) (better terminal)
* [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (package manager)
  * reattach-to-user-namespace (fixes some issues between tmux and Mac, ex. copy/paste)
  * coreutils (ls colors & other things)
* [iTerm2-Color-Schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes) (color schemes for iTerm2, currently using Tomorrow Night Eighties)
### All OS:
* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) (shell)
  * this will generate a new .zshrc so I like to just edit the new .zshrc to have the correct theme (agnoster) and plugins.
* tmux (2.1 or above)
* [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) (plugin manager for vim)
* [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (vim, but better, kind of)
* [powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) (for various prompts/statuslines â€“ Meslo Powerline is nice)
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (a fuzzy finder that makes it easier to search for files and through history)
* [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
* [z](https://github.com/rupa/z) (keeps a cd history and makes it easier to jump to stuff)
* set up any relevant language servers for coc.nvim

## Other Setting Stuff
* Remap Caps Lock to Control
* Make sure that iTerm2 allows applications to access the clipboard
