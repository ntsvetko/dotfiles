# My Setup

I'm including some config files as well as general lists of things that I use here.

## Included in Repo
* `.vimrc`
* `.zshrc`
* `.tmux.conf`

## Things To Download
* oh-my-zsh (also I edited the alanpeabody prompt to include an emoji by changing the PROMPT line to PROMPT="${user} ${pwd} $emoji[spiral_shell]")
* tmux
* pathogen
  * youcompleteme (this also requires specific versions of vim so pay attention to the instructions)
  * vim-go
  * syntastic
* homebrew (if it's a Mac)
* iTerm2 (if it's a Mac)

## Other Stuff
* I'm using the "Afterglow" color scheme and I like it! (you can get it in iTerm2-Color-Schemes)
* Remap Caps Lock to Control

*WARNING* don't just copy the files! A lot of things in them are specific to the setup of this laptop. I'm just including them to remind myself some of the things that I do to customize my setup.
