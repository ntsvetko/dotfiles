# My Setup 🌟

I'm including some config files as well as general lists of things that I use here.

## Things To Download
### Mac OS X:
* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) (better terminal)
* [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (package manager)
  * reattach-to-user-namespace (fixes some issues between tmux and Mac, ex. copy/paste)

### All OS:
* tmux 
* [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) (plugin manager for vim)
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (a fuzzy finder that makes it easier to search for files and through history)
