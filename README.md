# My Setup

I'm including some config files as well as general lists of things that I use here.

## Included in Repo
* `.vimrc`
* `.zshrc`
* `.tmux.conf`
* `.theme.conf` -- tmux theme file

## Things To Download
* oh-my-zsh (also I edited the alanpeabody prompt to include an emoji by changing the PROMPT line to PROMPT="${user} ${pwd} $emoji[spiral_shell]")
* tmux
* reattach-to-user-namespace (fixes some issues between tmux and Mac, ex. copy/paste)
* vundle
* homebrew (if it's a Mac)
* iTerm2 (if it's a Mac)
* some kind of powerline font (Meslo Powerline, perhaps)

## Other Stuff
* I'm using the "Afterglow" color scheme and I like it! (you can get it in iTerm2-Color-Schemes)
* Remap Caps Lock to Control
* make sure that iTerm2 allows applications to access the clipboard
* Airline themes I like: alduin, raven, bubblegum, sierra, understated

*WARNING* don't just copy the files! A lot of things in them are specific to the setup of this laptop. I'm just including them to remind myself some of the things that I do to customize my setup.
